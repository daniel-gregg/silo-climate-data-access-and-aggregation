# To Do list

## flow
* rebase 'calc_vars' main functions to functional coding:
    * single function to operationalise processing with different aggregation functions selected by args
    * check function for existing data
    * year-by-year saving of data to csv and checking of existing data so can just run an update instead of full processing

* add soil moisture (??)
