# To Do list

## flow
* change flow to iterate over all processing elements var-year at a time instead of iterating of vars/years for each independent process
    * This allows to integrate masking and zonal stats calculation into a single flow to reduce burden on storage

* change data collation to collate a single .csv file instead of many. 

* add NDVI 
* add soil moisture
